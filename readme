**INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT*
 
Basic building blocks of the web
-HTML
-CSS
-JS

==>JS is a high-level interpreted language used to make web pages interactive or dynamic

--> It runs directly in your browser when linked to a HTML file.

JavaScript does the following:
1. User-interactivity -> the ability of the webpage to respond to user action.
(button clicks, animations, form inputs)
2. Reactivity

Where do we write javascript?
-Internal Javascript:
  JavaScript code is written in a script in a HTML file
   a. in the body section; right above the closing body tag (the recommended way)
   b. in the head section; 

-External Javascript (BEST WAY TO WRITE JS)
  Create an external javascript file with a .js extension and then link it to a HTML file using a src (source attribute)

VARIABLES
--> is a named container or memory space used to store values.

**WAYS OF DECLARING VARIABLES IN JS*
1. Using let keyword
**Most common way of declaring a variable*
 -They can be reassigned
 e.g let x = 20 // initial value
        x = 5 // reassignment

2. Using const keyword
--> Variables cannot be reassigned
    e.g const name = "Killian" // can't be changed

3. Using var keyword
**works just like let but is outdated

DATA TYPES AND OUTPUT
String - represents textual data / characters enclosed in quotations
Number - represents numeric values - both whole numbers and floating point numbers
Boolean - represent truth values - True and False

To Output:
we use console.log() //equilavent to print

Checking for data types
we use typeof()
 
**JS can run in two environments
1. In the browser -> client side JS
2. In the server -> NodeJS


**Comments*
-a way of documenting your code - commented lines are ignored by the interpreter.
 -> Types of comments
 1.Multiline comments -> /* */ a comment that takes more than one line.
 2.Single line comments -> // a comment that takes only one line.

 **STRING METHODS AND OPERATIONS*
 Methods are inbuilt functions that are manipulate data

 1. Concatenation - joining or combining two strings
              - Using "+" operator
              - Using concat() method

 2. Template literal - a way of embedding or including variables inside string
              - Using backticks (` `), $(dollar sign), {variable }

 3. Accessing characters in a string - strings are ordered therefore we can use index.
    However, we don't have -ve indexing.

 4. Determine no of characters in a string - .length
 5. .slice() - returns the portion or substring of a full string
        .slice(start, end)
        slice allows -ve indexing

 6. toUpperCase() - converts a string to uppercase format
 7. toLowerCase() - converts a string to lowercase format
 8. .includes() - determines whether a string ends with a specified character or substring is part of a Boolean value

 9. .startsWith() - checks if a string begins with the specified character or substring
 10. endsWith() - checks if a string ends with the specified character or substring.
  returns a boolean value
 
 11. indexOf() - returns the first occurrence of a specified character or characters.
 12. replace() - replaces specified character(s) withh a new value
          e.g replace(old_value, new_value)
 13. .trim() - removes whitespace from a string
             - trimLeft() or trimStart()
             - trimRight() or trimEnd()

 14. split()

**NUMERIC OPERATIONS*
1.addition -> +
2.subtraction -> -
3.division -> /
4.multiplication -> *
5.exponent - **
6.modulus - %
7.increment -> ++ (increase by 1)
8.decrement -> -- (decrease by 1)
9.toString() - changes a number to a string
10.toFixed() - rounds off a number to specified decimal places
11.Math.round() - rounds a number to the nearest integer
12.Math.floor() - rounds down
13.Math.ceil() - round up

       **LESSON 2*
**User Input* 
  -makes programs interactive and dynamic
  -In JS we take user input using prompt()
  -Any data coming from user input is always a string

  **Changing Data Type*
  1.Strings - Numbers
  2.Numbers - Strings
  3.Boolean conversions

1. Type conversion -> manual changing of data from one type to another
                   -> explicitly done by the programmer

**Convert string to number
    1. Number() - converts string to number
    2. parseInt() - converts string to integer
    3. parseFloat() - converts string to float

    Convert number to string
    a. String()
    b. toString()

2. Type coercion - where data is automatically changed from one type to another by the languange / intepreter
      -> not changed by the programmer
      -> Polymorphism - operator overloading ->an operator takes more than one form 
      -> concat -> addition

JS OPERATORS
 -> Operators are symbols used to perform specific tasks
 -> We have 4 categories of operators:

 1.Arithmetic Operators
 - addition(+)
 - subtraction(-)
 - division(/)
 - multiplication(*)
 - exponentiation(**)
 - modulus(%)
 - increment(++) increases by 1
 - decrement(--) decreases by 1

 2.Comparison Operators -- compares values
 - < -> less than
 - > -> greater than 
 - <= -> less than or equal to
 - >= -> greater then or equal to
 - == -> equality operator
 - === -> strict equality operator
 - !== -> strict inequality operator
 - != -> inequality operator

 3.Logical Operators -- assigns values
  && - Logical and ---> returns true only if both conditions are true
  || - Logical or ---> returns true if at least one condition is true
  !  - Logical not --> returns the opposite of a Boolean value

 4.Assignment Operators - assigns values
 = (assign)
 += (add and assign)
 -= (subtract and assign)
 *= (multiply and assign)
 /= (divide and assign)
 **= (raise to a number assign the number to a value)
 %= (get remainder and assign)

 5.TASK 
 Slide 56 and 57
1. Find out what the 'in' operator does and illustrate with Javascript code - use w3schools or geeksforgeeks as references

2. Write a program that takes 2 numeric user inputs and outputs the following:
  -> their sum
  -> their subtraction
  -> their modulus
  -> their exponent

3.  review & redo any undone task on slide 57


**CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS*
-> Enables us  to write programs that make decisions based on inputs

-> if-else statements 
-> syntax: {}---> represents a block

scenario -> you have multiple conditions
if, else if, else

if (condition) {
  code to execute if condition is true
} else if (condition 2) {
  code to execute
} else if {
  code to execute
} else {
  code to execute if none of the conditions are met
}
 
      **In class Task**
1.Write a program that checks which number is the largest
among 3 numbers --> takes user input

2.Using if statements write a program that checks whether a number is odd or even

**ternary operator**
-> ?
-> shorthand for if-else statements
-> works only when there is one condition
-> syntax:
   condition ? expression if condition is true : expression if condition is false

   In class task
1.Write a program using ternary operator that checks whether a person is an
eligible voter -> criteria: an eligible voter has to be 18 years old or older

**Task**
-Slide 66

Nested if
-> An if statement within another if statement
e.g.Write a js program that checks if a variable student_score
 is greater than 90. If true, check if the attendance is greater than 80. 
 If both conditions are true, display"Excellent student", otherwise display
  "Good score, but attendance needs improvement"

**TASK**
1.Write if…else to print:
"Empty" if string length is 0
"Short" if 1–5 characters
"Medium" if 6–10 characters
"Long" if more than 10 characters


2.Write a program that calculates the ticket price 
based on age with the following conditions: age below
12 pay a ticket price of 5, age below 18 pay a ticket 
price of 10, age below 60 pay a ticket price of 20,
age over 60 play a ticket price of 15.


3.Write a program that calculates a discount based on the
 purchase amount.Prices equal or over 100 discount have a 
 discount of 20. Prices equal or over 50 have a discount of 10.
Otherwise discount is 0


4.Write an if…else that prints "Match" if a variable val is the 
number 5 or the string "5", but does not match "05" or 5.0.


5.Given a variable str, write an if…else that prints:
"Empty" if it’s an empty string or whitespace only
"Number" if it can be converted to a number (e.g., "123")
"Text" otherwise


6.Write if…else to handle a variable num such that:
Print "Integer" if it’s a whole number
Print "Float" if it’s a number but has decimals
Print "Not a number" otherwise


7.Check if the season is Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer. If the user input is :
September, October or November, the season is Autumn.
December, January or February, the season is Winter.
March, April or May, the season is Spring
June, July or August, the season is Summer


8.Write a JavaScript that takes 3 numeric inputs and outputs them
in ascending order from smallest to largest

9.Write a program to check whether the last digit entered by a user is divisible by 3

                **JS DATA STRUCTURES**
-> Use d/ss to store multiple values in variables
1.Arrays
2.Objects

                **JS ARRAYS**
-> A data structure used to hold muliple values in an ordered manner
-> represented using []
-> this is the equivalent of lists in Python

                **Properties of Arrays**
1.They are ordered  - uses indexing
        N/B:- *No -ve indexing in JS arrays
2.They are mutable - values can be changed
3.They can contain multiple values of any data type

-> Values in an array are comma-separated

                **Array Operations**
1.Creating an array 
2.Accessing values in an array - use indexing 
        -> indexing is zero based 
3.Updating values in an array - use index 
4.Determine the no of values in an array => length
5.Adding items to an array:
        a) Add at the end - push()
        b) Add at the beginning - unshift()
6.Removing items from an array:
        a) Remove the first item - shift()
        b) Remove the last item - pop()

        **task**
        **Research on what each of the methods below do and how they're used:
7.splice()
8.slice()
9.indexOf()
10.lastIndexOf()
11.includes()
12.sort()
13.reverse()
14.join()
15.toString()
16.copyWithin()
17.at()
