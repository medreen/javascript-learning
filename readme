**INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT*
 
Basic building blocks of the web
-HTML
-CSS
-JS

==>JS is a high-level interpreted language used to make web pages interactive or dynamic

--> It runs directly in your browser when linked to a HTML file.

JavaScript does the following:
1. User-interactivity -> the ability of the webpage to respond to user action.
(button clicks, animations, form inputs)
2. Reactivity

Where do we write javascript?
-Internal Javascript:
  JavaScript code is written in a script in a HTML file
   a. in the body section; right above the closing body tag (the recommended way)
   b. in the head section; 

-External Javascript (BEST WAY TO WRITE JS)
  Create an external javascript file with a .js extension and then link it to a HTML file using a src (source attribute)

VARIABLES
--> is a named container or memory space used to store values.

**WAYS OF DECLARING VARIABLES IN JS*
1. Using let keyword
**Most common way of declaring a variable*
 -They can be reassigned
 e.g let x = 20 // initial value
        x = 5 // reassignment

2. Using const keyword
--> Variables cannot be reassigned
    e.g const name = "Killian" // can't be changed

3. Using var keyword
**works just like let but is outdated

DATA TYPES AND OUTPUT
String - represents textual data / characters enclosed in quotations
Number - represents numeric values - both whole numbers and floating point numbers
Boolean - represent truth values - True and False

To Output:
we use console.log() //equilavent to print

Checking for data types
we use typeof()
 
**JS can run in two environments
1. In the browser -> client side JS
2. In the server -> NodeJS


**Comments*
-a way of documenting your code - commented lines are ignored by the interpreter.
 -> Types of comments
 1.Multiline comments -> /* */ a comment that takes more than one line.
 2.Single line comments -> // a comment that takes only one line.

 **STRING METHODS AND OPERATIONS*
 Methods are inbuilt functions that are manipulate data

 1. Concatenation - joining or combining two strings
              - Using "+" operator
              - Using concat() method

 2. Template literal - a way of embedding or including variables inside string
              - Using backticks (` `), $(dollar sign), {variable }

 3. Accessing characters in a string - strings are ordered therefore we can use index.
    However, we don't have -ve indexing.

 4. Determine no of characters in a string - .length
 5. .slice() - returns the portion or substring of a full string
        .slice(start, end)
        slice allows -ve indexing

 6. toUpperCase() - converts a string to uppercase format
 7. toLowerCase() - converts a string to lowercase format
 8. .includes() - determines whether a string ends with a specified character or substring is part of a Boolean value

 9. .startsWith() - checks if a string begins with the specified character or substring
 10. endsWith() - checks if a string ends with the specified character or substring.
  returns a boolean value
 
 11. indexOf() - returns the first occurrence of a specified character or characters.
 12. replace() - replaces specified character(s) withh a new value
          e.g replace(old_value, new_value)
 13. .trim() - removes whitespace from a string
             - trimLeft() or trimStart()
             - trimRight() or trimEnd()

 14. split()

**NUMERIC OPERATIONS*
1.addition -> +
2.subtraction -> -
3.division -> /
4.multiplication -> *
5.exponent - **
6.modulus - %
7.increment -> ++ (increase by 1)
8.decrement -> -- (decrease by 1)
9.toString() - changes a number to a string
10.toFixed() - rounds off a number to specified decimal places
11.Math.round() - rounds a number to the nearest integer
12.Math.floor() - rounds down
13.Math.ceil() - round up

       **LESSON 2*
**User Input* 
  -makes programs interactive and dynamic
  -In JS we take user input using prompt()
  -Any data coming from user input is always a string

  **Changing Data Type*
  1.Strings - Numbers
  2.Numbers - Strings
  3.Boolean conversions

1. Type conversion -> manual changing of data from one type to another
                   -> explicitly done by the programmer

**Convert string to number
    1. Number() - converts string to number
    2. parseInt() - converts string to integer
    3. parseFloat() - converts string to float

    Convert number to string
    a. String()
    b. toString()

2. Type coercion - where data is automatically changed from one type to another by the languange / intepreter
      -> not changed by the programmer
      -> Polymorphism - operator overloading ->an operator takes more than one form 
      -> concat -> addition

JS OPERATORS
 -> Operators are symbols used to perform specific tasks
 -> We have 4 categories of operators:

 1.Arithmetic Operators
 - addition(+)
 - subtraction(-)
 - division(/)
 - multiplication(*)
 - exponentiation(**)
 - modulus(%)
 - increment(++) increases by 1
 - decrement(--) decreases by 1

 2.Comparison Operators -- compares values
 - < -> less than
 - > -> greater than 
 - <= -> less than or equal to
 - >= -> greater then or equal to
 - == -> equality operator
 - === -> strict equality operator
 - !== -> strict inequality operator
 - != -> inequality operator

 3.Logical Operators -- assigns values
  && - Logical and ---> returns true only if both conditions are true
  || - Logical or ---> returns true if at least one condition is true
  !  - Logical not --> returns the opposite of a Boolean value

 4.Assignment Operators - assigns values
 = (assign)
 += (add and assign)
 -= (subtract and assign)
 *= (multiply and assign)
 /= (divide and assign)
 **= (raise to a number assign the number to a value)
 %= (get remainder and assign)

 5.TASK 
 Slide 56 and 57
1. Find out what the 'in' operator does and illustrate with Javascript code - use w3schools or geeksforgeeks as references

2. Write a program that takes 2 numeric user inputs and outputs the following:
  -> their sum
  -> their subtraction
  -> their modulus
  -> their exponent

3.  review & redo any undone task on slide 57


**CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS*
-> Enables us  to write programs that make decisions based on inputs

-> if-else statements 
-> syntax: {}---> represents a block

scenario -> you have multiple conditions
if, else if, else

if (condition) {
  code to execute if condition is true
} else if (condition 2) {
  code to execute
} else if {
  code to execute
} else {
  code to execute if none of the conditions are met
}
 
      **In class Task**
1.Write a program that checks which number is the largest
among 3 numbers --> takes user input

2.Using if statements write a program that checks whether a number is odd or even

**ternary operator**
-> ?
-> shorthand for if-else statements
-> works only when there is one condition
-> syntax:
   condition ? expression if condition is true : expression if condition is false

   In class task
1.Write a program using ternary operator that checks whether a person is an
eligible voter -> criteria: an eligible voter has to be 18 years old or older
